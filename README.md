# Graphics Final Project

### Siliang Lei (Period 4)

## Features We Want To Implement
1. light
    - Add a light to the symbol table
    - When calculating diffuse and specular: loop through all the lights.
2. set
    - Assign a value to a knob
3. saveknobs
    - Save current knob values to a list
4. tween
    - Produce an animation by going between two knob lists
5. shading
    - Use different shading techniques / calculating I more or less frequently.
    - A hash tables structure can be very helpful for dealing with vertex normals. If you are woking in c, check out uthash.
6. save_coordinate_system
    - Save a copy of the top of the stack to the symbol table
    - use this coordinate system when drawing shapes (extra argument required)
